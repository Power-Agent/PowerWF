PowerWorkflow is an open-source collection of agentic workflows for power system applications. These workflows enable intelligent automation and coordination of power system operations, facilitating efficient management and control in the energy domain.

## üåü What is Agentic Workflow?

Agentic workflows are step-by-step processes that process logic together. They provide a structured way to implement intelligent behavior without explicit agent programming. Key features include:

- Automated execution of complex power system operations
- Integration with various power system software and tools ([PowerMCP](https://github.com/power-agent/PowerMCP))
- Reusable workflow components for different use cases
- Flexible orchestration of multiple tools and services

## ü§ù Our Community Vision

We're building an open-source community focused on advancing workflow automation in the power domain. Our goals are:

- **Collaboration**: Connect power system experts, workflow developers, and automation specialists
- **Innovation**: Create and share powerful workflows for various power system applications
- **Education**: Provide resources and examples for implementing workflow automation
- **Standardization**: Develop best practices for workflow design in the energy sector

## üöÄ Getting Started with PowerWorkflow

### Video Demos

Check out these demos showcasing PowerWorkflow in action:

- [**Grid Impact Evaluation for Large Load Interconnection**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/LxF8RqsNf04): This demo showcases how Agentic AI can streamline the grid impact evaluation process for large loads like data centers. Using domain-adapted AI Agents equipped with tools such as PowerWorld, the workflow automates data analysis, contingency studies, and report generation‚Äîaccelerating a process that traditionally requires extensive manual effort.
